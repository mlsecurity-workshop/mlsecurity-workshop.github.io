We will explore vulnerabilities in deployed learning systems, examine attack vectors in practical scenarios, and discuss defense mechanisms for robust ML deployment. The workshop is inspired by research from the KINAITICS project, which investigates kinematic indicators for adversarial behavior detection in AI systems. The event brings together researchers, academics, and industry professionals to discuss cutting-edge developments in adversarial machine learning, security implications, and mitigation strategies for production environments.\n\n\n\nRafaël Pinot (Sorbonne University) and Cédric Gouy-Pailler (CEA)"
