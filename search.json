This talk will begin with a general introduction to backdoor threats, \n  outlining the attack assumptions, threat models, and real-world implications. It will then present a series of concrete attack and defense strategies \n  developed in recent research. The keynote will conclude with a forward-looking perspective on either the use of watermarking for model ownership \n  verification or the unique challenges posed by backdoor attacks in federated learning.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Dr. Benjamin NEGREVERGNE\n      LAMSADE, PSL-Paris Dauphine University\n      Associate Professor\n    \n  \n  Keynote 2: Adversarial attacks and mitigations\n  Abstract: Adversarial machine learning no longer centers on imperceptible pixel tweaks. \n  As foundation models become multimodal and instruction-tuned, the attack surface shifts to safety \n  alignment itself and to the prompts that govern multi-turn reasoning. This talk frames these trends—adversarial \n  alignment and prompt-level manipulation—using recent studies on large language and vision-language systems as \n  touchstones, and outlines why future defenses must address both model internals and their interactive context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Registration Form (Attendance only)\n\nRegistration Form\n\n  \n    \n      Nom (Last Name) *\n      \n    \n    \n      Prénom (First Name) *\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Email *\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Affiliation/Institution *\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Position *\n      \n        -- Select Position --\n        Professor\n        Researcher\n        Post-doctoral Researcher\n        PhD Student\n        Master Student\n        Industry Professional\n        Other\n      \n    \n    \n      Country\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Participation Type *\n    \n      \n        \n        Attendance only\n      \n\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Presentation Title\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      Abstract (max 300 words)\n      \n    \n    \n    \n      Published Paper Reference (if applicable)\n      \n      \n        Note: Proposals based on published papers will be given priority for talk slots.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    I consent to the processing of my personal data for this event *"
